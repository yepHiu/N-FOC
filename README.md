# N-FOC
> N-FOC is a project that utilizes Field-Oriented Control (FOC) technology on brushless motors, and it's something I've always wanted to do during my university years. Taking advantage of the time before graduation, I want to try to complete this project thoroughly. The "N" stands for "NiZhou," which in Chinese means "sailing against the current." This symbolizes overcoming difficulties and moving forward, which is the spirit of the laboratory I joined during my university years. There, I met many companions and gained friendships.
